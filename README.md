# Shark Attack Data Analysis
Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset on shark attacks using pandas and numpy libraries in Python. The main goal of this project is to test three different hypotheses using the data. We will perform some data cleaning, and then explore some hypotheses about the data.

# Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Data: We use the shark attack data from the attacks.csv file. This dataset contains information on shark attacks that occurred from the mid-1500s to 2018. The dataset includes columns such as date, country, age, and activity, among others.

# Hypotheses
1.There are more shark attacks in the United States than in Australia.
2.There were more fatal shark attacks on individuals under 18 years old than on individuals over 18 years old.
3.Which age group has the most shark attack cases and fatalities.

# Data Cleaning
We followed the below steps to clean the data:

Looked into the data and checked the proportion of missing data.
Checked the data type of each column and made changes accordingly.
Dealt with missing values.
Extracted more information from the dataset to get additional variables.
Checked the unique values of columns and eliminated those that were not required.
Cleaned the age column by replacing and/or removing values that were not numeric or useful.

# Results
The hypothesis 1 that there are more shark attacks in the United States than in Australia is true.
The hypothesis 2 that there were more fatal shark attacks on individuals under 18 years old than on individuals over 18 years old is inconclusive.
The hypothesis 3 results are that the all age ranges are between 20% and 28% mortality versus total attacks.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project shows how to read, manipulate, and analyze data using Python and Pandas. It also illustrates how data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis process. The results of the analysis provide some insight into the frequency and age of shark attacks in different regions.
